# 0000 Use Architecture Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

How do we document and track architectural decisions made during the project
lifecycle? We need a lightweight way to capture the context, options considered,
and rationale behind significant technical choices.

## Considered Options

* No formal documentation — rely on commit messages and code comments
* Wiki pages — centralized documentation but disconnected from code
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — lightweight markdown files in the repository

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Architecture Decision Records" because:

- ADRs live alongside the code in version control
- They provide a clear template for capturing context and rationale
- Historical decisions remain accessible even as team members change
- The numbered format creates a natural chronological log
- Markdown format is easy to write and renders well in GitLab/GitHub
